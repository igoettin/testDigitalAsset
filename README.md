This respository contains a simple program that calculates data related to digital assets.

The data is calculated through the following formula:

(BTC/GOLD) = X

X / 100 = Y

Y / 30-Year Risk Free Rate = Z

Z* 100 = A

A / 30 Years = B

B = Multiple of digital asset growth vs. real asset growth

B * Current Earnings Growth in Equity Markets = Annual Digital Asset Growth Rate (ADAGR)

(ADAGR * n. Years) * (Digital Asset Price) x (% of Digital Asset Market Share) = G

G*(1 Year Digital Asset Growth/1 Year BTC Growth)

= Digital Asset Price in n. Years
